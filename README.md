# Microsoft-Power-BI-Analyzed-e-commerce-sales-
Analyzed e-commerce sales data and developed an interactive dashboard using Microsoft Power BI to deliver actionable business insights. The project involved collecting and merging raw sales datasets, cleaning and transforming the data with Power Query, and creating calculated columns such as profit, profit margin, and discount impact for advanced analysis. The dashboard visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) including total sales, profit, order volume, and profit margin, along with monthly trends, category-wise performance, top and bottom products, and regional sales analysis. Interactive filters and drill-down features enable users to explore customer segments, product categories, and geographic trends in detail, supporting data-driven decision-making and strategic business growth. The project showcases Power BIâ€™s capabilities in transforming complex sales data into clear, visually compelling reports for stakeholder.
